This code processes raw NAV data in to manageable CSV and spatial files for visualization and spatial analyses. It is an R script which will reduce the raw file size by ~90% extracting one position per record and avoiding multiple overlapping positions. 
This script can be improved by reducing the resolution of the data (e.g., one position per minute vs multiple positions per second), to make the file outputs smaller and easier to manage.
